# Audio-responsive Drawing Tool with Analog interaction

## What I plan to build
- Extending my project 1 to develop an interactive drawing tool in which users draw on the interface while audio adjusts some quality of the strokes
- An sensor input will allow users to control how sound affects the composition

## Technical considerations
- Arduino set-up
- Websocket for serial connection
- p5.js for audio frequency analysis and brushstroke visualization
 
## Design considerations
- Strokes visually reflect energy and embodied human gesture
- Upload audio → draw → adjust physical sensor

### Success
- Demonstration of a direct relationship between sound, gesture, and drawing behavior

## Challenges
- Establishing a mapping that feels conceptually meaningful 
- Real-time communication between Arduino and p5.js without lag


## Revised Goals (based on feedback)
- Using an accelerometer to map energy in someone's body movement
- Changing the stroke width based on sensor input
