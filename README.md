# Taneesha

Hi! My name is Taneesha Panda and I'm a 4th year undergrad pursuing a B.S. in Data Science with a minor in Art. Iâ€™m curious about the intersection of art and technology, particularly touch-feedback/embodied systems for musical expression. In my free time I like to play my violin, bake, and do yoga.
